# 54. Bikes Last Used

## Problem Description

You are given a table `dc_bikeshare_q1_2012` that contains information about bike share rides. Each row represents one ride.

Your task is to **find the last time each bike was used** (i.e., the most recent time it was returned).  
Return both the `bike_number` and the **latest `end_time`**, ordered by the most recently used bikes.

| Column Name       | Type     |
|-------------------|----------|
| duration          | text     |
| duration_seconds  | bigint   |
| start_time        | timestamp|

## Example Output

| bike_number | last_used          |
|-------------|--------------------|
| W01278      | 2012-03-31 19:28:00|
| W01097      | 2012-03-31 15:37:00|
| W00270      | 2012-03-31 12:10:00|
| ...         | ...                |

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    bike_number, 
    MAX(end_time) AS last_used
FROM 
    dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
GROUP BY 
    bike_number
ORDER BY 
    last_used DESC;
```

---

## Explanation

### 1. `MAX(end_time)`
- We use the aggregate function `MAX()` to get the **latest timestamp** when each bike was last returned.

### 2. `GROUP BY bike_number`
- This ensures that the aggregation (MAX) is applied **per bike**.

### 3. `ORDER BY last_used DESC`
- Sorts the results from the **most recently used** bikes to the **least recently used** ones.
