# 56. Customer Details

## Problem Description

You are given two tables, `customers` and `orders`, with the following structures:

### `customers` Table
| Column Name   | Type     |
|---------------|----------|
| id            | bigint   |
| first_name    | text     |
| last_name     | text     |
| city          | text     |
| address       | text     |
| phone_number  | text     |

### `orders` Table
| Column Name       | Type     |
|-------------------|----------|
| id                | bigint   |
| cust_id           | bigint   |
| order_date        | date     |
| order_details     | text     |
| total_order_cost  | bigint   |

### Task

Find the **details of each customer** (first name, last name, and city) **regardless of whether the customer made an order**. Include the order details (if any) from the `orders` table.

Sort the output:
1. By the customer's `first_name` in ascending order.
2. By the `order_details` in ascending order.

## Example Output

The query should produce an output similar to:

| first_name | last_name | city            | order_details |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Emma       | Isaac     | Miami           | NULL          |
| Eva        | Lucas     | Arizona         | Coat          |
| Eva        | Lucas     | Arizona         | Shirts        |
| Eva        | Lucas     | Arizona         | Slipper       |
| Farida     | Joseph    | San Francisco   | Cap           |
| Farida     | Joseph    | San Francisco   | Coat          |
| ...        | ...       | ...             | ...           |

Here, even customers **without any orders** appear in the result with `NULL` for `order_details`.

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    a.first_name,
    a.last_name,
    a.city,
    b.order_details
FROM 
    customers a
LEFT JOIN 
    orders b 
ON 
    a.id = b.cust_id
ORDER BY 
    a.first_name, 
    b.order_details;
```

---

## Detailed Explanation

1. **LEFT JOIN Usage**  
   - We use `LEFT JOIN` because we need to include **all customers**, even those who **haven’t placed any orders**.  
   - A normal `INNER JOIN` would exclude customers without orders.

2. **Selected Columns**  
   - From `customers`: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `city`.  
   - From `orders`: `order_details`.  
   - Other fields like `order_date` or `total_order_cost` aren’t needed per the question.

3. **Sorting**  
   - First by `first_name` (ascending).  
   - Then by `order_details` (ascending).  
   - For customers with no orders, `order_details` will appear as `NULL` (and sort to the top by default).
