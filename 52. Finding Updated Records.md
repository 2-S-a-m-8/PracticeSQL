## Problem Statement

We have a table `ms_employee_salary` with employee records, including outdated salaries. The task is to find the **most recent (highest) salary** for each employee, assuming salaries increase over time. 

We need to output:
- `id`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `department_id`
- `current (maximum) salary`

Sort the final result by `id` in **ascending** order.

## Table: `ms_employee_salary`

| Column         | Data Type |
|----------------|-----------|
| id             | bigint    |
| first_name     | text      |
| last_name      | text      |
| department_id  | bigint    |
| salary         | bigint    |

## Solution Using Window Function

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    department_id,
    MAX(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY first_name, last_name) AS salary
FROM ms_employee_salary
ORDER BY id;
```

## Explanation

### Key SQL Concepts Used

- **Window Function:**  
  `MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY first_name, last_name)`  
  This computes the **maximum salary** for each employee (grouped by name), **without collapsing rows**.

- **PARTITION BY first_name, last_name:**  
  Groups records by full name, assuming names uniquely identify employees. If multiple entries exist for the same name, it still calculates the max salary across those.

- **DISTINCT:**  
  Removes duplicates in case the same employee's salary appears multiple times.

- **ORDER BY id:**  
  Ensures results are sorted by employee `id` in ascending order as required.

## Notes

- This solution assumes `first_name + last_name` uniquely identifies each employee.  
  If there are multiple people with the same name, we might need a more robust identifier (e.g., email, or id + timestamp).
- If the `id` alone is unique per employee, a better solution would be to use `PARTITION BY id` instead of names.
