### ‚úÖ SQL Query with Explanation  
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```
---

### Explanation

Let‚Äôs break down the logic:

1. SELECT name:<br>
We only want to retrieve the name of the customers.<br>

2. FROM Customer:<br>
The data source is the Customer table.<br>

3. WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL:<br>
This condition ensures we exclude any customer who was referred by the customer with id = 2.
We use referee_id IS NULL to include those who were not referred by anyone.
!= 2 includes all customers referred by someone other than customer 2.
