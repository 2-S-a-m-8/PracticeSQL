# 57. Number Of Bathrooms And Bedrooms 

## Problem Description

We are given a table `airbnb_search_details` with the following relevant columns:

| Column              | Type    |
|---------------------|---------|
| city                | text    |
| property_type       | text    |
| bathrooms           | bigint  |
| bedrooms            | bigint  |

The goal is to:
1. **Find the average number of bathrooms (`bathrooms`) and bedrooms (`bedrooms`)** for **each combination of city and property type**.
2. Output the results as:
   - `city`
   - `property_type`
   - `n_bathrooms_avg` (average bathrooms)
   - `n_bedrooms_avg` (average bedrooms)

---

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    city,
    property_type,
    AVG(bathrooms) AS n_bathrooms_avg,
    AVG(bedrooms) AS n_bedrooms_avg
FROM airbnb_search_details
GROUP BY city, property_type;
```

## Detailed Explanation of the Query

1. **Column Selection (`city`, `property_type`):**  
   These columns represent the dimensions by which we want to group the data. The averages will be calculated for each unique `(city, property_type)` pair.

2. **Aggregation with `AVG()`:**  
   - `AVG(bathrooms)` computes the average number of bathrooms for each group.
   - `AVG(bedrooms)` computes the average number of bedrooms for each group.
   - The `AVG()` function **ignores NULL values by default**, so missing data will not skew results.

3. **`GROUP BY city, property_type`:**  
   This ensures that the dataset is partitioned into groups by `city` and `property_type`. Each group will then have its averages calculated.

4. **Column Aliases (`AS n_bathrooms_avg`, `AS n_bedrooms_avg`):**  
   These aliases rename the output columns to match the expected result format, making the results more descriptive.

## Why This Query Works

- The query leverages SQLâ€™s aggregation functions to calculate grouped statistics.  
- By grouping first, we avoid duplicate calculations and only compute averages once per group.  
- The query is highly efficient because it uses a single scan with aggregation.

## Sample Output

| city     | property_type | n_bathrooms_avg | n_bedrooms_avg |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| NYC      | Apartment     | 1.1167           | 1.25            |
| LA       | Cabin         | 3                | 1               |
| SF       | House         | 1.4              | 1.8             |
| LA       | Villa         | 2.0667           | 2.5333          |
| LA       | House         | 1.5              | 1.5588          |
| ...      | ...           | ...              | ...             |

This is based on the sample results from the problem.
