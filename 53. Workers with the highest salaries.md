# 53. Workers With The Highest Salaries

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Platform:** StrataScratch

## Problem Statement

You are given two tables: `worker` and `title`. Each employee has a job title stored in the `title` table and a salary stored in the `worker` table.

**Objective:**  
Return the job titles of the employees with the **highest salary**.  
If more than one employee has the same highest salary, include all their job titles.

## Table Definitions

### Table: `worker`

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                    |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| worker_id     | bigint  | Primary key                    |
| first_name    | text    | Employee's first name          |
| last_name     | text    | Employee's last name           |
| salary        | bigint  | Employee's salary              |
| joining_date  | date    | Date the employee joined       |
| department    | text    | Department of the employee     |

### Table: `title`

| Column Name     | Type    | Description                         |
|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| worker_ref_id    | bigint  | Foreign key referencing `worker_id` |
| worker_title     | text    | Employeeâ€™s job title                |
| affected_from    | date    | Date from which the title was active |

## SQL Solution

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        b.worker_title,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a.salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM worker a 
    INNER JOIN title b 
        ON a.worker_id = b.worker_ref_id
)
SELECT 
    worker_title AS best_paid_title 
FROM cte
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Join `worker` and `title` tables

```sql
FROM worker a 
INNER JOIN title b 
    ON a.worker_id = b.worker_ref_id
```

- We join the `worker` table (`a`) and `title` table (`b`) on the `worker_id` and `worker_ref_id` fields to access both salary and job title for each employee.

---

### Step 2: Use a CTE and DENSE_RANK()

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        b.worker_title,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a.salary DESC) AS rnk
    ...
)
```

- A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** named `cte` is defined.
- We apply the **`DENSE_RANK()`** window function to rank employees **by salary in descending order**.
- `DENSE_RANK()` is ideal here because it handles ties: multiple employees with the same salary get the same rank.
- The rank `1` will be assigned to the employee(s) with the **highest salary**.

---

### Step 3: Filter only top earners

```sql
SELECT worker_title AS best_paid_title 
FROM cte
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

- From the ranked results in the CTE, we select only those rows where `rnk = 1`, i.e., the **highest salary** earners.
- We rename the column as `best_paid_title` for clarity in output.

## Sample Output

| best_paid_title |
|-----------------|
| Manager         |
| Asst. Manager   |

> Assuming both of these titles belong to employees with the highest salary in the dataset.

## Key SQL Concepts Used

- **JOIN**: To combine data from two related tables.
- **DENSE_RANK()**: Assigns ranks with no gaps when there are ties.
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: Used for modular and readable SQL.
- **Filtering on Window Function Output**: Common technique to get top-N results.
