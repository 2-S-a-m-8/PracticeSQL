# 48. List the Products Ordered in a Period 

## Problem Statement

You are given two tables: `Products` and `Orders`. The task is to write a query that returns the names and total units of those products that had **at least 100 units ordered in February 2020**.

---

## Schema

### Products
| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| product_id       | int     |
| product_name     | varchar |
| product_category | varchar |

- `product_id` is the primary key.
- Contains data about the companyâ€™s products.

### Orders
| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| unit          | int     |

- `product_id` is a foreign key to the `Products` table.
- `unit` is the number of products ordered on `order_date`.

## Example

**Input:**
Products:
```
| product_id | product_name          | product_category |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------|

| 2          | Jewels of Stringology | Book             |
| 3          | HP                    | Laptop           |
| 4          | Lenovo                | Laptop           |
| 5          | Leetcode Kit          | T-shirt          |
```

Orders:
```
| product_id | order_date | unit |
|------------|------------|------|
| 1          | 2020-02-05 | 60   |
| 1          | 2020-02-10 | 70   |
| 2          | 2020-01-18 | 30   |
| 2          | 2020-02-11 | 80   |
| 3          | 2020-02-17 | 2    |
| 3          | 2020-02-24 | 3    |
| 4          | 2020-03-01 | 20   |
| 4          | 2020-03-04 | 30   |
| 5          | 2020-02-25 | 50   |
| 5          | 2020-02-27 | 50   |
```

**Output:**
```
| product_name       | unit |
|--------------------|------|
| Leetcode Solutions | 130  |
| Leetcode Kit       | 100  |
```

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(unit) AS unit
FROM Products a
INNER JOIN Orders b ON a.product_id = b.product_id
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') = '2020-02'
GROUP BY product_name
HAVING SUM(unit) >= 100;
```

---

## Explanation

1. **Join**: `Products` is joined with `Orders` using `product_id` so we can access the product name alongside order information.

2. **Filter by Date**:
   - `DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') = '2020-02'` selects only the records from **February 2020**.

3. **Grouping**:
   - We `GROUP BY product_name` to aggregate the number of units ordered per product.

4. **Having Clause**:
   - `HAVING SUM(unit) >= 100` filters to include only those products whose total orders in Feb 2020 are **100 units or more**.
