## Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

- `db_employee`: contains employee details including salary and department ID.
- `db_dept`: contains mapping between department IDs and their department names.

> **Task**:  
Calculate the **absolute difference** between the **highest salaries** in the **Marketing** and **Engineering** departments.

> Output just the absolute difference as a single number.

## Table Schemas

### `db_employee`

| Column Name   | Data Type |
|---------------|-----------|
| id            | bigint    |
| first_name    | text      |
| last_name     | text      |
| salary        | bigint    |
| department_id | bigint    |

### `db_dept`

| Column Name | Data Type |
|-------------|-----------|
| id          | bigint    |
| department  | text      |

---

## Sample Output

Assuming:
- Highest salary in **Marketing (id=1)** is 6500
- Highest salary in **Engineering (id=4)** is 8900

Output:
```
2400
```

## Thought Process

1. The question asks for **only the absolute difference** between **maximum salaries** of two specific departments.
2. We're told those departments are **Marketing** and **Engineering**, so we must first know their `department_id`s.
3. Let's assume:
   - Marketing has `department_id = 1`
   - Engineering has `department_id = 4`  
   *(You would typically confirm this using a JOIN or a WHERE clause on `db_dept` table. But in this exercise, we assume IDs are known.)*
4. We need to:
   - Get the **maximum salary** from each department
   - Subtract one from the other
   - Take the **absolute value**

---

## Final SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    ABS(
        (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM db_employee WHERE department_id = 4) -
        (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM db_employee WHERE department_id = 1)
    ) AS salary_difference;
```

---

## Explanation 
### Subquery 1:
```sql
(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM db_employee WHERE department_id = 4)
```
- This finds the **highest salary** among all employees in **department_id = 4** (Engineering).
- `MAX(salary)` scans all rows matching the filter and picks the largest salary value.

### Subquery 2:
```sql
(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM db_employee WHERE department_id = 1)
```
- Similarly, this retrieves the **highest salary** in **Marketing** department (`department_id = 1`).

### Difference:
- The subtraction computes how much more one department's top salary is over the other.

### `ABS()` Function:
```sql
ABS(...)
```
- Ensures the result is **always positive**, i.e., it returns the **absolute difference** regardless of which department has the higher salary.

### Output:
- We alias the result as `salary_difference` (optional), which improves readability.

## Notes

- If department names were not known by ID, you'd use a `JOIN` to map `department_id` â†” `department`:
  ```sql
  SELECT id FROM db_dept WHERE department = 'Marketing';
  SELECT id FROM db_dept WHERE department = 'Engineering';
  ```

- But since IDs are assumed known (`1` for Marketing, `4` for Engineering), subqueries suffice.
