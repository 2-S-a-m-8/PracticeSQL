## Problem Description

You are given an `employee` table with the following schema:

| Column Name       | Type    |
|--------------------|---------|
| address           | text    |
| age               | bigint  |
| bonus             | bigint  |
| city              | text    |
| department        | text    |
| email             | text    |
| employee_title    | text    |
| first_name        | text    |
| id                | bigint  |
| last_name         | text    |
| manager_id        | bigint  |
| salary            | bigint  |
| sex               | text    |
| target            | bigint  |

### Task

For each employee, compare their salary with the **average salary of their department**.  
Output the following columns:

- `department`
- `first_name`
- `salary`
- `avg_salary` (average salary for that department)

---

## Sample Output

```text
department   first_name   salary   avg_salary
Sales        Sam          1000     1336.3636
Sales        Henry        2000     1336.3636
...
Management   Allen        200000   175000
Audit        Michale      700      950
```

## Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    department, 
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary  
  FROM employee
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT 
  a.department,
  a.first_name,
  a.salary,
  b.avg_salary
FROM employee a 
INNER JOIN cte b 
  ON a.department = b.department;
```

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Step 1: Compute the average salary per department (CTE)**

   ```sql
   WITH cte AS (
     SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
     FROM employee
     GROUP BY department
   )
   ```
   - Here we calculate the average salary for each department.
   - `GROUP BY department` ensures we aggregate salary values by department.
   - The result is a temporary table (`cte`) with two columns: `department` and `avg_salary`.

2. **Step 2: Join the computed averages back to the main table**

   ```sql
   SELECT a.department, a.first_name, a.salary, b.avg_salary
   FROM employee a
   INNER JOIN cte b 
     ON a.department = b.department;
   ```
   - Each row from `employee` (aliased as `a`) is matched to its department’s average salary from `cte` (aliased as `b`).
   - This results in every employee’s record including their department’s average salary.

3. **Why use a CTE instead of a Subquery?**
   - A **CTE (Common Table Expression)** makes the query more readable and modular, especially when the aggregated result is reused or the logic is complex.
   - While a subquery could achieve the same, the CTE improves clarity.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for scanning the employee table plus O(d) for grouping by department (`d` = number of departments).  
- **Space Complexity:** O(d) for storing the department-level average salaries in the CTE.

---

## Alternative Approach (Using Window Functions)

Instead of a `CTE`, we could use a window function:

```sql
SELECT 
  department,
  first_name,
  salary,
  AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS avg_salary
FROM employee;
```

- This avoids the explicit join by computing the average directly for each row.
